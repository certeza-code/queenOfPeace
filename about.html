                   <p style="text-align: justify;font-weight: 400;font-family:serif;">Historically, Queen of Peace Girls' Secondary School, was established in the year 1997 by his Lordship RT. Rev. Dr. Anthony Ilonu of the blessed memeory, the then Bishop of Okigwe Diocese.<br> The school is located at Umueze 1 Ehime Mbano LGA of Imo State. During that period, there was only one community school in the village which was not able to cater for the students academically. In view of this,the Catholic Bishop of Okigwe, his priests and the pastoral council of St. Michaels parish, Umueze1 decided to establish a catholic school to allow the school children grow deep in God's faith and also grow in academic and moral upbringing. The school was then entrusted into the hands of the sisters of the congregation of Daughters of Mary Mother of Mercy(DMMM) through the invitation by the then bishop of Okigwe Diocese during the tenure of Rev. mother Mary Paul Offia of the blessed memory. Before the coming of the Mercy sisters, the parish priest in september 1997, already gathered some girls who started attending the school at Umuawuchi-owerre hall. </p>
                   <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: serif;">In March 1998, the Mercy sisters came and accepted the challenge to run the school with almost little to nothing. The first principal of the school, Rev. Sister Mediatrix Akujiobi ran the school from Umunakanu on daily basis. After some time, the principal not feeling comfortable with her daily shuttling from Umunakanu to Umueze opted to move the school down to the dilapidated CWO hall. From foreign aids and little local contributions, she was able to renovate the building which served as classroom blocks, hostels and the sisters convent.</p>

                    <a href=""><img class="" id="schImg" src="img/school2.jpg"></a>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12" style="text-align: justify;font-family: serif;">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;" >As the school grows and the number of students increased, the principal in order to make the students comfortable requested some portions of lands from Umuarugo people to expand the school. Her request was granted by some good spirited families of Umuarugo who donated some portions of land free of charge for the building of the school. The school will forever remain grateful for all her donors.<br>With the little proceeds from the school and funds from foreign aids, the principal commenced the building of the classrom blocks. She was able to erect Six classrooms, administrative blocks, science and computer laboratories. The school was later moved to its permanent site at Umuarugo village, Umueze1 after the compleetion of the school building.</p>
                    <p>The history would not be complete without mentioning the unquantifiable support from an illustrious son of Umueze1, an uncommon philanthropist of our time, a man with a large heart, good spirited individual, Chief Tony Chukwu who singlehandedly built an ultra modern hostel for the students and has been the chief benefactor of the school. Daddy, we doff our cap for you. Thanks a million times. To Chief Engr.Uche Onyeji and all our benefactors, we will remain ever grateful. God bless you all richly.</p>
                    <p>Since its inception, the school has recorded five principals viz: Rev. sister Mediatrix Akujiobi(1998-2007), Rev. sister Lydia Okafor(2007-2008), Rev. sister Epiphanie(2008), Rev. sister Bribasil Okorie(2008-2018), Rev. sister Rita Mario Ibeabuchi(2018-till date). The approval to establish and run the school was given by the Government of Imo State Ministry of Education in 1998. Sequel to that was the approval of the school to partake in the writing of the West African Examination Council(WAEC) and National Examination Council(NECO) examinations in 2003.We are proud to witness  Seventeen sets of students passing out of our school with execellent results and good moral upbringing.</p>

                    <p> Education could be seen as an instrument for achieving socio-economic and             technological growth and development of any nation. For one to be educated, one      needs to undergo a learning process.One of the most acceptable definitions of         learning is that it is a relatively permanent change in behaviour which occurs        as a result of experience training or practice,hence the saying, "practice makes      perfect or you learn thing by doing it."</p>
                    <label style="font-weight: 500; text-transform:capitalize;">terms associated with           learning</label>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Maturation: Mc Meil and Rubin define it as the unfolding of inherited             biological patterns that are programmed into individual.</li>
                        <li>Mental set: Chainman defines it as a tendency of behaving in a particular way     or predisposition to act in a given way.</li>
                        <li>Readiness: A learner is in a state of readiness to do something when he is        physically,psychologically and mentally set to perform the act.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12" style="font-weight: normal;font-family: serif;">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Punishment: The use of a painful or discomforting stimulus in order to            increase the probability that an undesirable behaviour will be terminated.</li>
                        <li>Reinforcement and Motivation: Acts of encouragement and providing a conducive     environment for learning.</li>
                        <li >Individual differences: This is the concept that no two individuals are          alike in all developmental characteristics such as; physical appearance,          temperament,interest,abilities,intelligence,cognitive styles.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is paramount to say that education and morality are complementary and inseperable because they contribute in the determining of the integral definition of a personality. Morality is learned,hence the scriptural passage;"teach the young the way they should go and they will never depart from it." Paul in his letter to the Romans 6:12-14, advices that we should get rid of worldly things as sexual immorality,insult,evil desires, hatred, jealousy, envy, greed, anger,etc. He went on to advice that we should be transformed to know the will of God,what is right and becoming.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">One disheartening misdemeanour in our society today is the menace of poor reading culture or bibliophobia(being afraid of book).Students' nowadays do not see the need to read/study hard.I enjoin all hands to the pump to correct this anomaly before it is too late as an Igbo Adage puts it; "Ka anyi choo ewu ojii mbge chi ka di."</p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify; font-weight: normal;">Parents and teachers are not left out in this fight against this hydra-headed monster.They should try as best they can to encourage students to read and widely for that matter.Parents in their own part have much work to do by providing all necessary textbooks and materials needed for the student.On holidays,parents should always encourage their wards to study.They can also be enrolled in holiday extra mural classes to minimise gallivanting.Remember,there is no magic in learning because it is one of the things one cannot do without. </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Teachers on the other hand should be conscientious in their work.Do not cheat but teach the students, give assignments, mark and correct them.By so doing,the inexplicable and immeasurable reward prepared for the teachers in heaven will be poured into your laps.Even here on earth then in heaven.Students/pupils,remember,if you can write your name,thank your teacher! </p>
